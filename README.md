## Decription

This repo contains a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. The calendar runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

You'll need to use the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Moment.js in the browser.
